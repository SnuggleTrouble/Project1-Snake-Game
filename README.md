# Project1-Snake-Game
# Overview
This is my attempt at making the classic snake game. 
You play a snake that grows in size when eating fruit.
The snake will be controlled by the arrow keys.
The canvas will be a fairly big size. All 4 walls will have collision, and so will the snake.
The goal of the game is to reach the biggest possible size.

# In order to create the game, several things are needed.
* Display the board and the snake
* Make the snake able to move with the arrow keys. The snake should move in the given direction automatically. 
* Create one fruit at a time that is randomly placed on the board.
* Make the snake grow in size by x amount whenever fruit is eaten.
* Create a scoreboard that indicates the snake's length. 
* The game should have a splash screen and a restart button if you get game over.
* The game should end if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
