# Project1-Snake-Game
# Description
This is my attempt at making the classic snake game.

You play a ridiculously hungry snake that just can't stop eating fruit.
The more fruit you eat the bigger you grow.

Be careful not to collide with the walls or yourself.

The goal of the game is to reach the biggest possible size and reach the highest possible score.

Best of luck!

# MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
* Display the board and the snake
* Make the snake able to move with the arrow keys. The snake should move in the given direction automatically. 
* Create one fruit at a time that is randomly placed on the board.
* Make the snake grow in size by x amount whenever fruit is eaten.
* Create a scoreboard that indicates the snake's length. 
* The game should have a splash screen and a restart button if you get game over.
* The game should end if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
